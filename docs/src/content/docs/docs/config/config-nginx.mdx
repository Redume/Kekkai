Kekkai is used by `Nginx` to redirect to the correct microservice.

## Change domain

Change localhost to your `domain` or `ipv4` based on your needs. 
If you need to use Kekkai locally, you don't need to change anything,

<Code code='
...
server_name localhost; # Your domain
...
'title='nginx.conf'/>


## Change name for SSL
This is where the name of the SSL files changes. This needs to be edited if you have a different one

Change `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` to the names of the files you have.

<Code code=
'
...
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem;
...
' title='nginx.conf'/>
